/* This is based on the technique described in https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html.
 * This function transforms AABBCCDD into 1000 * AA + 100 * BB + 10 * CC + DD,
 * with the caveat that all components must be in the interval [0, 25] to prevent overflow
 * due to the multiplication by power of 10 (10 * 25 = 250 is the largest number that fits in a byte).
 * The advantage of this method instead of using shifts + 3 multiplications is that this is cheaper
 * due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
 *
 * The difference here however is that the first mask uses 0xff instead of 0x0f.
 * This doesn't make a difference when a byte is in the range [0, 9], but it has an extra advantage.
 * By setting the mask to 0xff we can already sum the two numbers in non-parsed form,
 * and the parsing will fix up the carry.
 * Here's how it works with an example:
 * Let's say A = [5 9 0 1] and B = [2 2 0 0], and we pass in A + B = [7 11 0 1]
 * We know that the highest number may only be 25 but that is no problem as the vectors only have
 * numbers in the range [0, 9] which means the sum vector has numbers in the range [0, 18].
 * Then [7 11 0 1] is transformed into 7 * 1000 + 11 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 1 = 8101,
 * which would have been the same as if the carry for the 11 would've been on the 7,
 * i.e. [8 1 0 1] would've been the right result, but that gives 8 * 1000 + 1 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 1 = *also* 8101.
